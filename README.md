# Java Fundamentals

These are exercises from Makers three-week course on Java.


----
In this module, you'll first see how to write and execute basic Java programs, and also learn about some important things such as how to use types and how to write tests using JUnit. You'll then build a more complex program (a CLI game) using object-oriented Java features.

## Learning objectives
* Test-drive a simple Java program.
* Explain the main differences between Java and a language like Ruby.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
